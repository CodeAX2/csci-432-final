Final project for CSCI 432
## Project Overview
Option 2: Choose a problem with multiple algorithms that solve it, discuss all 3 algorithms, and implement 1.

### Problem Overview:
Wedding table seating assignment.

You are planning the seating arrangement for a wedding. Given N tables, each with M seats at a table, 
decide which table each of the N*M guests should sit at.

Each guest is a person that has relationships with all other people. Relationships include:
- Friends
- Enemies
- Neutral

The goal is to seat people who are friends at the same table, while avoiding seating enemies at the same table.

Three possible algorithms to solve this are:
- Backtracking
- Simmulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm (our implementation)
